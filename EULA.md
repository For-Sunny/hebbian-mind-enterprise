# END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)
**Hebbian Mind Enterprise**
**Effective Date: January 26, 2026**
**Version: 1.0**

---

## 1. PARTIES & DEFINITIONS

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is between **C.I.P.S. LLC**, a Virginia limited liability company ("CIPSCORPS LLC," "Licensor," "we," "us," or "our"), and the individual or organization purchasing the Software ("Customer," "Licensee," "you," or "your").

### 1.1 Definitions

**"Software":** The CIPSCORPS LLC product(s) identified in the purchase confirmation, including **Hebbian Mind Enterprise**, together with all documentation, updates, and related materials provided by CIPSCORPS LLC.

**"Developer":** An individual human being who installs, accesses, configures, deploys, tests, or uses the Software in any capacity. Each Developer license is assigned to a specific NAMED individual and covers that individual's use across unlimited devices (laptop, desktop, server, etc.).

**"Organization":** The legal entity (corporation, LLC, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other business structure) purchasing the license. Includes all subsidiaries, affiliates, and entities under common control.

**"Production Use":** Any use of the Software beyond individual testing or evaluation, including but not limited to: deployment in commercial applications, use with customer data, integration into revenue-generating systems, or operation in live environments.

**"Effective Date":** The date of purchase as indicated in the purchase confirmation email.

## 2. LICENSE GRANT

### 2.1 Grant of Rights
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and full payment of applicable fees, CIPSCORPS LLC grants Customer a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license** to install and use the Software.

### 2.2 Per-Developer Licensing Model

Each license purchased grants **ONE (1) named Developer** the right to install and use the Software on unlimited devices under their direct control. The number of licensed Developers must equal or exceed the number of individuals who install, access, or use the Software within your Organization at any given time.

**How It Works:**
- Purchase 10 licenses = Assign to 10 named individuals (Bob, Alice, Carol, etc.)
- Each named individual can install on multiple machines (laptop, desktop, servers)
- Licenses are tied to individuals, not machines or concurrent usage
- A Developer who leaves the Organization permanently (termination, resignation) frees up their license for reassignment to a new individual

**Examples:**
- Bob (licensed) installs on laptop + desktop + home server = OK
- Alice (licensed) uses from office, home, and while traveling = OK
- Bob (licensed) shares login with Dave (unlicensed) = VIOLATION
- 10 licenses but 12 people using the Software = VIOLATION (need 12 licenses)

**Audit Compliance:**
Customer shall maintain a list of named licensed Developers. Upon audit request (Section 4), Customer must provide the names and roles of all individuals using the Software.

**Pricing Structure:**
- **Base License:** Covers one (1) Developer - **$800**
- **Additional Developers:** **$80** per additional Developer
- **Current Pricing:** See https://cipscorps.io/pricing

### 2.3 Permitted Uses
You MAY:
- Install the Software on unlimited machines for each licensed Developer
- Use the Software for internal business purposes within your Organization
- Create backups for disaster recovery purposes
- Deploy the Software in production environments within your Organization
- Create derivative works for internal use only (modifications remain subject to this Agreement)

### 2.4 Prohibited Uses
You MAY NOT:
- Transfer, sublicense, rent, lease, or redistribute the Software to any third party
- Offer the Software as a service (SaaS) to external customers or end users
- Share licenses with individuals outside your Organization
- Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright notices, license files, or attribution
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software (except as expressly permitted by applicable law)
- Use the Software to develop, distribute, or market competing products or services
- Allow more Developers to use the Software than licenses purchased

### 2.5 License Scope Clarification

**Named Developer License:** Licenses are assigned to specific named individuals, not concurrent users or machine seats. Once assigned, a Developer license cannot be reassigned to another individual except upon permanent departure from the Organization (termination, resignation, etc.).

**Reassignment Rules:**
- Bob quits -> His license can be reassigned to new hire Carol
- Bob goes on vacation -> Cannot temporarily reassign to Dave
- Bob works part-time -> Still requires full license (no pro-rating)

This is an honor system backed by audit rights. We trust customers to comply in good faith.
